They usually integrate software development tools in a GUI environment, and auto-configure/use these tools for you. Oftentimes, IDEs focus on one language or technology. You can think of an IDE as a text editor, but with a focus on code. Similar to tools like Google Docs, which aids with the writing process (grammar checks, spell checks, formatting), IDEs aid in the development process. They are (usually) easy to use, and can greatly accelerate and simplify the process of developing code. Here are some common IDE features:\n","\n","- Code Editor\n","    - Syntax Highlighting\n","    - Autocomplete\n","    - Autoformatting\n","    - Inline Messages\n","- Build Automation\n","    - Wrapping various build tools\n","    - Packaging binaries\n","    - Automated Testing\n","    - Hooks into Continuous Integration systems\n","- Debugging\n","- Code Analysis\n","    - Style checks\n","    - Static code analysis\n","\n","You do not have to know all of these concepts to use an IDE effectively! Just be aware that the best IDEs provide these features and integrate them in a way that aids with development.\n","\n","## What is VSCode?\n","\n","VSCode is a modular IDE. What this means is that most of the functionality VSCode has is derived from modules you can install. This allows you to extend VSCode in various ways, which makes VSCode a very powerful tool. This also means that VSCode is language-agnostic, meaning that it does not have a focus on a particular language or technology, and can be configured to work with almost anything. This system also makes VSCode very easy to configure, as most of the time you can get the functionality you need by simply installing an extension. It's this reason why we recommend VSCode to all club members! A lot of the time, many high-level projects utilize multiple components, so flexibility in your IDE is very important. Plus, VSCode supports all of the IDE features listed above, and integrates them in a very easy to use way.\n","\n","Long story short, VSCode is very configurable and extendable. You can fine tune and add features to VSCode to fit your development style."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1JfixdTwdAaA"},"source":["# Installing VSCode\n","\n","VSCode is very easy to install, and it is available to many platforms (including your browser!). We will cover installing VSCode on your platform in this section.\n","\n","## Windows\n","\n","Installing on windows is easy! Simply navigate to the download page:\n","\n","[https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n","\n","![Windows Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ohLtl1m8d-YIDU29vQFIh94JM-bXgQ_j)\n","\n","And download the installer for windows. Run the installer after it is downloaded. Accept the license agreement, and you can use the default options, although we would recommend adding a desktop icon for VSCode so you can easily locate the program:\n","\n","![Windows Install](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15A7NGoc0UZ5159lVMJjTAtM0e4Z_6gc0)\n","\n","VSCode is now installed! You can start the program by clicking on the desktop icon, or by using the windows search bar.\n","\n","## Mac OS\n","\n","Installing on MacOS is also very simple. Navigate to the download page:\n","\n","[https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n","\n","![Mac Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1UCMgLAKKiBIIU3f-qYv8TKjrOw2_zz-g)\n","\n","And download the installer for Mac OS. Run the installer after is is downloaded. Accept the license agreement, and you can use the default options without any issue.\n","\n","## Linux\n","\n","Linux installs are a bit more complicated. Microsoft provides `deb` and `rpm` distributions, but it is recommended to use your package manager to handle the install and update process. We will through the install process of a few common Linux distros.\n","\n","### Ubuntu\n","\n","On Ubuntu based distros, it is recommended to install vscode via [snap](https://snapcraft.io/):\n","\n","```bash\n","sudo snap install --classic code\n","```\n","\n","Snap auto-updates it's packages, so you will not need to interact with snap for updates going forward, as it will do the process for you automatically.\n","\n","### Debian\n","\n","For debian bases distros, it is recommended to install the `deb` package provided on the VSCode download page:\n","\n","[https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n","\n","![deb Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1gVwVq42fEAPtLV_Oz87tQLGyGY7h3L13)\n","\n","Once the `deb` package is downloaded, install it via apt:\n","\n","```bash\n","sudo apt install ./[FILE]\n","```\n","\n","Where [FILE] is the `deb` file you have just downloaded. This will not only install VSCode for use, but it will also add the VSCode repositories and signing keys to your system, which will allow apt to fetch new updates for VSCode when they are released.\n","\n","### RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS\n","\n","For RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS based distributions, Microsoft ships VSCode packages in their own yum repository, which can be added like so:\n","\n","```bash\n","sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\n","sudo sh -c 'echo -e \"[code]\\nname=Visual Studio Code\\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\\nenabled=1\\ngpgcheck=1\\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\" > /etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo'\n","```\n","\n","From here, you should update the package cache and install the VSCode package:\n","\n","```bash\n","dnf check-update\n","sudo dnf install code\n","```\n","\n","Please be aware that due to the way Microsoft packages VSCode, there may be a delay in updates in the yum repo. This means that you may have to wait a bit for the latest VSCode updates, as the packages may take some time to appear on the yum repository.\n","\n","### Arch Linux\n","\n","There is a community maintained VSCode package in the Arch Linux User Repository:\n","\n","[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code-bin)\n","\n","Installing packages from the AUR is beyond the scope of this module, but you can read about it on the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Build_and_install_the_package). You could also use a tool like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) to do all this for you.\n","\n","## Browser\n","\n","VSCode can be ran in your browser:\n","\n","[https://vscode.dev/](https://vscode.dev/)\n","\n","This offers a very easy way to work with VSCode on systems where it is not installed, or on platforms that do not support VSCode. This tool can be very useful, but we would recommend against using it as your main VSCode instance, as the web version is slower and does not support as many [features/extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web#_limitations)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Tckn1z3QdAaA"},"source":["# VSCode Extensions\n","\n","As stated before, VSCode can be extended in may ways! We will recommend some extensions here, and later go into configuring them.\n","\n","## Installing Extensions\n","\n","Installing extensions in VSCode is very easy! First, navigate to the extension menu in VSCode:\n","\n","![Extension Icon](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1A5y3Dbw6EVFeSsoQBx2Q009i3uraQgC6)\n","\n","The extension menu is where you will install and manage your extensions. On a new install, VSCode displays some recommended/popular extensions that you may be interested in. To see information on a specific extension, you can click on it and VSCode will display some information. We recommend you read through the description of each extension and understand what exactly it is doing! Installing a bunch of random extensions that you may not understand or use could lead to slowdowns and strange functionality.\n","\n","To install an extension, simply click on the extension you want to install, and then press the install button:\n","\n","![Extension Install](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kjg-Us_DNawJs6sct45TlRfD6p1pwpZY)\n","\n","This will install the extension to VSCode! Extensions can do many things, and can expose themselves in many ways, so it is recommended to research into the particular extension you have installed to learn how to use it.\n","\n","You can uninstall extensions in a similar way, go to the extension menu, click on the extension, and then press the `uninstall` button. You may have to reload VSCode for the extension to take effect.\n","\n","## Python Extensions\n","\n","This section recommends some extensions for working with python code.\n","\n","### Python\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)\n","\n","This extension is mandatory for working with python code! It provides python language support in VSCode, so installing this is a must!\n","\n","### Pylance\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)\n","\n","The python extension supports many language servers, which provide autocomplete and code analysis. The simplest python language server is Pylance, which is developed by Microsoft for VSCode. Simply install the extension, and VSCode will use it as your python language server. Again, other language servers are supported by the python extension, but they require a complicated install procedure, and the python extension needs to be configured to talk to them. It is for this reason we recommend pylance, as it is feature rich and easy to install.\n","\n","### autoDocstring\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)\n","\n","This extension auto-creates docstrings for your python code, which documents what your components do, what your components accept and return, and what types your comments should work with. This allows your code to be self documenting, which is a topic well beyond the scope of this module, but self-documenting code is generally something you want to aim for. There are many formats for python docstrings, and using these formats can be confusing and tedious.\n","\n","This extension aims to eliminate the complexities with python docstrings. It will auto-create docstrings for you, and will highlight the sections you need to fill in. The extension also allows you to create docstrings in various formats. This tool is invaluable when writing well documented code.\n","\n","## Jupyter Extensions\n","\n","VSCode is a very powerful tool for working with Jupyter notebooks! VSCode can render and work with notebooks, as well as provide editing tools for manipulating notebooks. There are a few notebook extensions, and you will want all of them:\n","\n","- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)\n","- [Jupyter Cell Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-jupyter-cell-tags)\n","- [Jupyter Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-keymap)\n","- [Jupyter Notebook Renders](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers)\n","\n","## Git Extensions\n","\n","[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that allows you to collaborate on software projects with others. Git is a very popular version control system! Most projects utilize it, and the MSU AI Club does utilize Git for ALL projects! VSCode has very rich Git support, and makes it easy to work with Git projects. We recommend some extensions that will add more git features to VSCode.\n","\n","### Git Graph\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)\n","\n","GitGraph is a classic VSCode extension! It allows you to visualize the commit history of a Git project, showing commit and branch information. Visualizing Git history can be tricky, so this visual aid can be very useful when working with Git projects.\n","\n","### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)\n","\n","This extension integrates GitHub concepts such as pull requests and issues in VSCode, allowing you to manipulate these in your editor. You can use the GitHub web interface if you wish, but some people find it useful to work with these in VSCode.\n","\n","## Generic Extensions\n","\n","These are some extension recommendations that do not fit into one category.\n","\n","### Code Spell Checker\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)\n","\n","This extension provides spell checking in VSCode! Incredibly useful and accurate. It does support multiple languages, so you can configure it to use a language you are comfortable with.\n","\n","### GitHub Copilot\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)\n","\n","Copilot is a very robust code generation tool using AI technologies. The features and usefulness of copilot is beyond the scope of this module, but you can check this out on the extension page. You should be aware that copilot requires a paid plan, unless you are a student! You can sign up for the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which will not only get you access to copilot and GitHub pro, but will also give you some other offers from other companies, Check it out, and sign up with your MSU email!\n","\n","### Hex Editor\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor)\n","\n","VSCode can also work with hex data, and this extension provides that functionality! Depending on what projects you are involved in, working with raw hex data can be uncommon. But when you need it, a hex editor can be extremely useful.\n","\n","### IntelliCode\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)\n","\n","IntelliCode is a Microsoft project that uses AI to power code suggestion results. This extension is useful for recommending certain results over others that may be more relevant based on your project.\n","\n","### IntelliCode API Usage Examples\n","\n","[Extension Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.intellicode-api-usage-examples)\n","\n","IntelliCode API Usage Examples is another Microsoft project that works with IntelliCode to provide usage examples on popular APIs.
