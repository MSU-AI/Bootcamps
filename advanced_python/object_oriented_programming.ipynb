The answer to the notebook will be all the way at the bottom of the notebook.\n","\n","Hey there! Today, we're going to learn about a super useful style of coding - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Now, you might be thinking, \"what is OOP?\" Well, let me explain by using an analogy of a school:\n","\n","  1. **Modularity for easier troubleshooting**: Imagine each class in a school as an object. If something goes wrong in the Math class, you know exactly where to go to fix it. You don't need to worry about what's happening in the English or History classes. It's all about keeping things separate and organized.\n","\n","  2. **Reuse of code through inheritance**: Think about the school again. There are rules that apply to all classes - like start and end times, or attendance policies. Instead of setting these rules for each class separately, we can set them up for the entire school and let each class inherit them. It saves time and keeps things consistent.\n","\n","  3. **Flexibility through polymorphism**: This is a big word that basically means one thing can take on many forms. Let's say every class in the school has a conduct_exam method. The way this method is implemented can differ from class to class. The Math class might have a multiple-choice test, while the English class might have an essay test. It's the same method, but with different implementations.\n","\n","  4. **Effective problem solving**: OOP helps us break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. It's like dealing with issues in one class at a time instead of trying to solve everything for the whole school at once.\n","\n","Let's look at how this works with a simple Python example:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1K8yWMEvqsig"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Here's our Class class (pun intended!)\n","class Class:\n","    def __init__(self, subject, students):\n","        self.subject = subject\n","        self.students = students\n","\n","# Now we'll make a Class object\n","math_class = Class('Math', 30)\n","\n","# And we can access the class's attributes like this\n","print(math_class.subject)\n","print(math_class.students)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dECqoCrMqzYa"},"source":["In this example, Class is our class (like the school's blueprint), and math_class is an object or instance of that class (like an actual class in the school). The __init__() function is a special method that gets called when we create a new object. And self? It's how we access attributes or methods of the object - in this case, subject and students.\n","\n","So, there you have it - a quick introduction to OOP! It's a powerful tool that can help make your code more organized, efficient, and easier to understand.\n","\n","\n","Lets get into some of the more messy details:\n","\n","# **Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n","\n","Alright, now that we've got a general idea of what OOP is, let's dig a little deeper and learn some key OOP concepts. Think of it as getting to know the students, teachers, and subjects in our school analogy!\n","\n","  1. **Objects**: Objects are like the students in a school. Each student has their own unique traits and abilities. In programming, an object is an instance of a class. It's like a single student belonging to a larger group (class).\n","\n","  2. **Classes**: Classes are like the subjects taught in a school. Just like a subject has a syllabus that defines what will be taught, a class in OOP defines the properties (called attributes) and actions (called methods) that an object can have.\n","\n","  3. **Methods**: Methods are like the actions or behaviors that a student can perform. In programming, methods are functions defined inside a class. They define the behaviors of the objects of the class. They are a lot like functions which we covered in the intro to python notebook. The main difference is Methods are functions inside classes.\n","\n","  4. **Attributes**: Attributes are like the traits or characteristics of a student. In programming, attributes are variables defined inside a class. They represent the state or quality of objects of the class.\n","\n","Now, you may be wondering, \"How is OOP different from other programming styles?\" Well, one common style is called procedural programming. It's like a teacher giving a lecture - they start at the beginning, go step by step, and finish at the end. But with OOP, it's more like a group discussion - different ideas (or objects) interact with each other to achieve the goal. It's a more dynamic and flexible way of programming.\n","\n","Let's see how we can create a class and an object in Python:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8j5aSnytsaTt"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Here's a class called Student\n","class Student:\n","    def __init__(self, name, grade):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.grade = grade\n","\n","    def study(self):\n","        return f\"{self.name} is studying.\"\n","\n","# Now let's create a Student object\n","john = Student('John', 'A')\n","\n","# We can access the object's attributes and methods like this\n","print(john.name)  # notice there is no '()' used for attributes\n","print(john.grade)\n","print(john.study())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e921rJntsePI"},"source":["In this example, Student is our class, and john is an object of the Student class.

If you have a base class, say School, with attributes like name, location, and principal, and methods like enroll_student and conduct_exam, you can create another class, say HighSchool, that inherits all these attributes and methods from the School class.

The teach method in the Teacher class could be implemented differently by a MathTeacher or an EnglishTeacher class. This allows for flexibility - the same method name can be used to perform different tasks.\n","\n","  3. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is like the private conversations between a teacher and a student. In OOP, it's the practice of keeping the attributes and methods of a class private (or hidden) so they can't be modified by external code. It's all about keeping our code safe and secure.

The @staticmethod decorator is like a counselor who provides guidance without needing to know the details about each specific student or class.
