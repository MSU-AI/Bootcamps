    "# Python Package Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Python be design in a very modular language, which allows for components to be from outside sources to be imported and used in your code. This allows you to utilize projects and code other developers have written! For example, lets say you would like to write a simple program that downloads a file from a website on command. It would take a long time to write the network code to make this request and preform the download operation, so instead we import code others have written to do the job for us, which greatly reduces our program complexity, and saves us a lot of time. The best developers are not only good at producing code, but also understanding when and how to delegate work to other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Python module?\n",
    "\n",
    "A python module is a python component that can be imported and utilized in your code. Modules allow you to use code others (or yourself) have written to solve a specific problem. For example, the `json` module is designed to parse and serialize JSON objects, converting JSON strings into Python dictionaries and vice a versa. Python modules are usually written in python, but they can be implemented in other languages, such as C. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Python package?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python package is a bundle that contains a module to be installed. You can think of a package as a box, a delivery method for the desired module inside. Packages are usually single files that contain the source of a module to be installed, but a package can also contain binary files, code to be compiled locally during installation, or even an entire git repo. 99% of the time, you should not have to worry about the specifics of packages, later on we will be introducing tools to do this work for you, but sometimes you may need to work with packages directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages have two types: source distributions and wheels. Source distributions are a collection of source code that may need to be processed of compiled before it is installed. Wheels are built distributions, meaning that it can be installed without any further processing. You should prefer wheels built for your platform, the tools below will always choose wheels over source distributions. If ne wheel exists for your platform, then a wheel will be created from the source distribution locally. Don't worry about the specifics of all this, the tools outlined below will handle all this for you, and 99% of the time you will never have to worry or deal with packages at this level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I download packages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has an official service called the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/), which is a service that allows developers to upload packages and users to download them, for free! This service also keeps a record of previous packages uploaded, allowing you to download an older package version if need be. PyPi contains the source distributions of each module, as well as prebuilt wheels (if the module developer provides them). PyPi also contains a description on the project, as well as links to places you can learn more about the module and how to use it. If you like, you can download any package files yourself from PyPi."

    "# Python Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will cover the ideas of python environments and why you should use them for every project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is containerized python environment that is independent of the global python install. They allow you to use a different set of modules, and keep project-specific dependencies and configuration in a specific location. Virtual environments are a single directory that contains all the components necessary for a python environment, including an interpreter, pip, activation/deactivation scripts, and a location for modules installed in the environment. A project that utilizes a virtual environment would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "+ project/\n",
    "|\n",
    "+-- file.py\n",
    "+-- README.md\n",
    "|\n",
    "+-- venv/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `venv/` is the location of the virtual environment. You can customize the name and location of the environment, most people just name it `venv/` and place it in the root of the project. Please note, you should not alter this directory, or the file in it yourself! For the sake of simplicity, treat `venv/` as a black box that should not be manipulated manually. You should only alter packages using tools like `pip`, and you should not put your project code inside the `venv/` directory!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use virtual environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python environments are very important, and every project you have, no matter how small, should utilize python environments in some way! Your system install should have a very small number of  3rd party modules. Here are some reasons why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules installed and shared in your system install are subject to some nasty dependency conflicts. Lets say you install `moduleA` version 1.0 for one of your projects. Let's also say you create a new project that requires `moduleA` version 2.0. If you install the requirements for project 2, then `moduleA` will be upgraded to the newer version. This works fine until you try to run project 1 and you get a really nasty failure. The version discrepancy would be very hard to mitigate, as python only allows one version of a module to be installed at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### System Pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operating systems come preinstalled with Python for various system tasks. These operating systems often put modules in the system install that are critical for proper operation. Installing other 3rd party modules can mess up the configuration, as sometimes modules interact with each other in ways that may be undesirable. If you run a Linux distro, polluting your system install of Python could lead to serious issues!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Irrelevant Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally not a good idea to use modules that are not necessary for your project. If you install everything to your system install, then many projects will have many modules available to it that it may never use. This is generally a bad idea, as again, modules can interact in ways that may be undesirable. We want to minimize the number of modules available to the program, and including modules it does not utilize is not going to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permission Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need administrator privileges to install system packages. This can lead to a lot of headache and complexity when you are trying to get the dependencies of your project figured out, so it is easier to use a virtual environment that does not require these privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up a virtual environment is very easy. Simply use the `venv` module like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv [PATH]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will use the `venv` module to create a virtual environment at the path specified. To create a virtual environment in the `venv/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is now created! If you use an IDE like VSCode, it should automatically detect this environment and load it by default. You can manually activate this environment by using the activation scripts. If you are on windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples are assuming the virtual environment was created in the root of your project in the `venv/` directory. This activation script will configure your currently running terminal instance to use the python components in the virtual environment instead of your system install. After you create and activate your environment, your prompt will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(venv) User@Machine $\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `(venv)` section on your prompt denotes that you are now using the virtual environment. From here, you can now install modules and configure python with no risk of breaking or polluting the system install."

    "# Installing Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will go through the process of installing python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is pip?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is a tool that manages python packages. `pip` is packaged with python, so you most likely already have it installed. It automates the process of downloading, building, and installing packages. It can pull packages from PyPi, install local packages, and even build wheels from git repositories! `pip` is the recommended way to manipulate python packages, as it is very powerful and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing packages from PyPi\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing packages from PyPi is very simple. Run pip like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install [NAME]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `[NAME]` is the name of the package to install. For example, if you want to install the requests package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will locate the project on PyPi, download the package, do any necessary processing steps, and then install the module to your environment. From here, you can use the package and import it normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing local packages\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` can also install local packages. Let's say you downloaded a wheel file from PyPi, you can install it like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install [PATH]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `[PATH]` is the path to the package you have downloaded. Again, pip will process and install this package to your environment, after which it can be used. It is not recommended to do this if you can help it, you should always prioritize PyPi for downloading packages!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing packages via Git\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` also has the ability to clone a git repo and install any python modules defined there. Some projects do not want to go through the hassle of packaging and submitting there wheel to PyPi, and instead recommend building the package from there git repo. Doing this is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install git+[URL]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `[URL]` is a URL to a git repo to work with. For example, if you want to install the package from `https://github.com/user/someproject`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/user/someproject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` will clone the repo, build the wheel for the package, and install the module. `pip` clones the git repo to a temporary location, which gets destroyed once work is complete. It is not recommended to install packages this way, you should almost always prefer PyPi, but sometimes this is the only distribution method provided for some projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Upgrading packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Upgrading packages is very easy. Simply provide the `-U` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U [NAME]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will upgrade the package. `pip` first checks PyPi for a new version. If one exists, then it will uninstall the old module and install the new module in it's place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to specify versions in `pip`. Simply use the equality operators, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==` to specify versions. For example, lets say I wanted to install version 2.0 or below for the module `module1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install 'module`<=2.0.0'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to quote the module name with version information! Many shells use the equality characters for other purposes, meaning the shell will try to do something weird and unintended with your command. Simply quote your package names and your shell will ignore them. `pip` will find the closest module to your requested version. For example, let's say `module1` has versions `1.0`, `1.2`, `1.5`, and I install it using the above command. Version `2.0` does not exist, but we specified that we are ok with a version less than `2.0`. In this case, `pip` will select the highest version it can find, that being `1.5`. If pip can't find a package matching that version, then it will display an error and cancel the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install from requirements file\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Python projects have a lot of dependencies. it would be tedious to manually type out these names in one command, so `pip` has support for reading modules from a file. This file can have any name, but the standard name is `requirements.txt`. Most projects will have this file in their root that you can use to install the necessary dependencies. The format of this file goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "module1\n",
    "module2\n",
    "module3==2.0\n",
    "module4>=4.0\n",
    "https://github.com/user/someproject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module to be installed is on a new line. Notice how the requirements file supports sources from git and package versioning. To install the modules defined in this file, you can use the `-r` option in `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` will iterate over the requirements file and install the necessary components. It is recommended that you create a requirements file in your projects, as it allows new developers to onboard quickly, and it provides a record of all dependencies for your project."
